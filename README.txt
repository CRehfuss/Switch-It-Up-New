README

To run the game run the Titlescreen.py file.

The controls will change with each level and you have to figure out what keys do what.

You will be given the controls in the bottom right hand corner after a certain number of wrong keys are pressed.

In the settings menu the sound can be turned on or off and the color of your dragon can be changed.

Avoid the fire in each level, if touched they will cause the player to lose a life. If all three lives are lost, you loose the game.

The hearts on each level are bonus lives.

Good Luck!
