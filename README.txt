README

To run the game run the Titlescreen.py file.

The controls will change with each level and you have to figure out what keys do what.

When the level begins, the four keys that control the player will be displayed in the lower right hand corner. However, the exact directions that each key moves the player is not specified. If the player is having enough trouble with the level (as demonstrated by pressing enough bad keys, or by running into a wall enough times), more details hints will be displayed in the lower right hand corner.

In the settings menu the sound can be turned on or off and the color of your dragon can be changed. When you select a certain dragon or sound setting a red box will display on your choice. When you hover over a dragon or sound choice a black box will be displayed over it. The sound can be turned off, but can be a useful indicator to how you're doing in the game. For example, a negative sound plays whenever you run into a wall or hit the fire.

On the player name screen you can input your name or you can input one of the cheat codes: Chesney, Konami, or promode. Chesney mode lets you fly through walls, Konami starts you off with an extra life, and promode only gives you one life to start out with. The cheat codes will work with the names in all lowercase, or with the first letter capitalized.

Avoid the fire in each level, if touched they will cause the player to lose a life. If all three lives are lost, you lose the game.

The hearts on each level are bonus lives. Running into a heart will grant you an additional life, but you may not have more than five hearts at any time.

On certain levels you have to obtain a key to remove the wall in front of the cake. 

Good Luck!
